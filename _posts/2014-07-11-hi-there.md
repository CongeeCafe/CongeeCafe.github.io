The second week of my last summer break is coming to an end. The sun's smiling, birds are chirping, and people everywhere are playing soccer. Amidst this temporary state of perfection, why not start a blog?

I'll begin my first post with some information about myself. I'm a Canadian student entering the University of Waterloo this year in their Computer Science program. Throughout my high school years, I've been fortunate to have been taught by some phenomenal computer science teachers. They led their classes by their genuine interest in the subject, and I attribute them for where I am today.

Moving forward into university, I decided to start a blog as a way to collect my thoughts, discuss topics related to my field, and perhaps talk about student life as well. It may also be interesting to look back upon in the future as a journal of my years to come at Waterloo.

So here it is. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I will.
